DockerScripts is a shell script framework for Docker which simplifies managing containers in a context\. Each container is like a virtual machine that has an application installed inside\. Each container has a base directory where the settings of the container are stored (in the file \fIsettings\.sh\fR)\. The command \fBds\fR picks the parameters that it needs from the file \fIsettings\.sh\fR in the current directory\.
